Introduction to Technology Radar
Four quadrants:
Techniques, tools, platforms, language and frameworks

Recommendation:
Adopt. Blips that we think you should seriously consider using.
Trial. Things we think are ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the Adopt ring. 
Assess. Things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet — unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you.
Hold. Proceed with caution.

Adopt
- Data product thinking
- Fuzz testing
- Software Bill of Materials
- Threat modeling

Trial
- API request collection as API product artifact
- Architecture advice process
- GraphRAG
- Just-in-time privileged access management
- Model distillation
- Prompt engineering
- Small language models
- Using GenAI to understand legacy codebases

Assess
- AI-friendly code design
- AI-powered UI testing
- Competence envelope as a model for understanding system failures
- Structured output from LLMs

Hold
- AI-accelerated shadow IT
- Complacency with AI-generated code
- Local coding assistants
- Replacing pair programming with AI
- Reverse ETL
- SAFe™
